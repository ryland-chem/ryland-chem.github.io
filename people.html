                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I am an <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/science/chemistry/people/faculty/profiles/giebelhaus-ryland.php">Assistant Professor of Chemistry</a> at the University of Victoria (UVic), having started July 1st, 2025. UVic is located in beautiful Victoria, British Columbia. I grew up in Kelowna, British Columbia, and always dreamed of calling BC home after graduate school. I am extremely grateful to live in one of the most beautiful places on the planet.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I completed my PhD in Chemistry at the University of Alberta (UofA) in Dr. James Harynuk's group and The Metabolomics Innovation Centre (TMIC). During my PhD I combined bench-top analysis with novel computational approaches to better use metabolomics to understand human interactions with our environment. Additionally, in April 2021 I was awarded the NSERC Canadian Graduate Scholarship - Masters (CGS-M), and in April 2023 I was awarded the CIHR CGS-D to support my doctoral work at the University of Alberta. In January 2024 I was awarded a Michael Smith Foreign Study Supplement (CGS-MSFSS), which I used to travel to the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, where I was a visiting scholar in the Analytical Chemistry laboratory headed by Dr. Jan Christensen. I was also awarded the 2025 Ryan Harris by the CSC. The Ryan-Harris is awarded to the top Canadian PhD graduate in Analytical Chemistry annually.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Prior to starting my graduate work at UofA, I completed my BSc (Hons.) at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan (UBC-O) campus in 2021. My interest in metabolomics was first sparked during my undergrad while researching in Dr. Susan Murch's plantSMART laboratory, where I worked on targeted and untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics approaches for the analysis of phytohormones. While at UBC-O I was awarded two NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards (USRA) and an Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science Undergraduate Research Award (URA). I also served as president of the Chemistry Course Union, hosting the 2019 Western Canadian Undergraduate Chemistry Conference (WCUCC).

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    In my spare time I enjoy hiking, cycling, camping, fishing, skiing, or playing a round of golf.

                    I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Victoria under the supervision of Dr. Ryland Giebelhaus. I am originally from Egypt and hold a bachelor's degree in biotechnology and Biochemistry from Cairo University. I have strong experience in both wet and dry lab techniques, including PCR, protein quantification, chromatography, spectrophotometric analysis, and data interpretation. My research focuses on metabolomics and analytical chemistry, where I am fascinated by uncovering the intricate biochemical patterns that define living systems. Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking, painting, and finding inspiration in the natural beauty of Vancouver Island.

                    I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Victoria and am pursuing a BSc in Physics and Biochemistry. Naturally, I am interested in interdisciplinary scientific research and the application of math to the physical and biological sciences. The opportunity to use chromatography and chemometrics to answer biological questions in the Giebelhaus lab is a very exciting one, and I am also very interested in studying our interaction with the environment via metabolomics. My current project addresses common issues seen in multidimensional chromatographic data such as skewed, rotated, and irregular peaks; I am developing methods to determine peak shape in 2D separations. In my free time, I enjoy staying active, whether it be through running, swimming, going to the gym, or exploring Vancouver Island via hiking and backpacking.

                   My name is Sam Byrne, and I grew up in Squamish, British Columbia. I am an undergraduate student in my fourth year studying Biochemistry at the University of Victoria. I have experience from my undergraduate courses, and I really enjoyed my biochemistry and microbiology labs. In my most recent lab we focused on HPLC peptide analysis and T cell response to cancer. I have a strong interest in gut microbiome health and how it relates to both our physical wellbeing and mental health. I also have an interest in studying women's health, which is a severely under researched group and needs more attention. In my free time I enjoy baking and making art, whether that be drawing, painting or ceramics. In Prof. Giebelhaus’ lab, I will be working to develop methods to standardize retention time prediction liquid chromatography (LC) and LC x LC.

                   I'm an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Victoria interested in computational biology. I am especially interested in harnessing deterministic algorithms and machine learning to augment medical diagnostic workflows. My current project addresses issues with determining an organism’s phenotype given its metabolome. Namely, I am using algorithms to identify the subset of metabolites within a metabolome that are most crucial to predicting an organism’s phenotype. Outside of the lab, I enjoy running, weightlifting and playing strategy games.

                  I am in my second year of study pursuing a BSc in Microbiology and Chemistry. I have
always had a strong interest in metabolomics and my time here at UVIC has allowed me
to gain experience and interest in chemical synthesis. In Professor Giebelhaus’ lab, I will
be working to synthesize isotopically labeled metabolites for use in further
research. Outside of school I love riding my bike around Victoria, rock climbing, hiking,
and exploring tide-pools.</p>
